# teleports

A simulation of the board game Teleports for 2 players, written in Python. The project was created as an assignment for the course PROG1.

## Game description

The game is played on a board of size n x n (where 5 <= n <= 10). Each player has one piece, which they try to move from the starting tile + to the target tile *. Movement is determined by rolling a 6-sided die.

There are randomly placed teleporters on the board:
    Uppercase letters (A, B, …) represent positive teleporters (move forward),
    Lowercase letters (a, b, …) represent negative teleporters (move backward).
    Pieces move in a snake-like pattern – in odd-numbered rows from left to right, in even-numbered rows from right to left.

The winner is the first player to land exactly on the target tile.
